# E-Commerce server written in Rust

Purpose of this project is to create a full-fledged E-commerce server with Rust using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework.

After completing the Rust book, it seems a logical step to create a real-world example. since I've already created E-commerce server multiple time with NodeJS, it seems to be the right choice to do the same with Rust ðŸ˜…


# Local Machine Setup
//TODO

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have latest stable version of rust [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine. After installing rust, check your rust compiler version with `rustc --version`. I'm using version `1.72.0`
3. Go to current reposity
4. run `cargo build`
5. run `cargo run`
6. Server should be started at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
7. To run the server in watch mode so you don't have to run `cargo run` after file change, first install

`cargo install cargo-watch`
``
then run

`cargo watch -x run`
